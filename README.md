# Goodies DB - A Redis implementation in Go

GoodiesDb started as a Redis implementation written in Go, serving as an educational project to learn and understand the inner workings of Redis, a popular in-memory data structure store. The current state of the project implements a subset of Redis's commands, including `AUTH`, `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, `EXISTS`, `SETNX`, `EXPIRE`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `TTL`, `SELECT`, `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `LPOP`, `RPOP`, `LRANGE`, `LTRIM`, `RENAME`, `TYPE`, `KEYS`, `INFO`, `PING`, `ECHO`, `QUIT`, `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL`.

**Disclaimer:** This is not a production-ready Redis clone and it is not intended for use in production environments (yet).

## Introduction
GoodiesDB aims to mimic the basic functionalities of Redis to provide a learning platform for developers interested in understanding distributed systems, data structures, and high-performance computing.

## Features
- In-memory key-value store
- Data persistence using RDB and AOF
- Support for lists, sets, and hash maps (planned)
- Publish/Subscribe messaging (planned)
- Basic transaction support 
- Lua scripting execution (planned)
- Master-slave replication (planned)
- Sharding (planned)

## Installation
To get started with Redis Clone, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andrelcunha/GoodiesDB.git
    cd GoodiesDB
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

## Usage
Run the GoodiesDb server:

```bash
make run
```
You can then interact with the server using PuTTY on raw TCP port 6379.
